		<h1>An Introduction to Configuration Management</h1>

		<p>Configuration Mnagement: (CM)
		Refers to the process of systematically handling changes to a system in a way that it mantains integrity over time.The term broadly refers to server configuration management.

Automation plays an essential role in SCM. It is the mechanism used to make a server reach a desirable state, previously defined by provisioning scripts using a tool's specific language and features.

Automation is the heart of configuration management for servers. This is why CM tools are referrd to as Automation tools or IT Automation tools.

Server Orchestration/ IT Orchestration: A term used to describe the automation features implemented by configuration management tools since these tools are capable of managing one to hundreds of servers from a central controller machine.
CM Tools available in the market: Puppet, Ansible, Chef, Salt.
Each tool has its own characteristics, and works in slightly different ways.
They all have the same purpose.
To ensure the system's state matches the state matches the state described by your provisioning scripts.

		<p>Benefits of Configuration Management for Servers

The use of CM typically requires more initial planning and effort than manual system adminstration.
all but the simplest of server infrastructures will improve from the benefits it provides.

	1. Quick provisioning of new servers:
When you need to deploy a new server (ie deploying means making a server operational) a CM tool can utomate most, if not all of the provisioning process for you. (Provisioning is setting up a server for use within a network.)
Automation makes provisioning much quicker and more efficient.
It allows tedious tasks to be performed faster and more accurately than any human could.
Even with proper and thorough documentation, manually deploying a web server for ex could take hours compared to a few minutes with CM.

	2. Quick recovery from critical events:
Another benefit of quick provisioning.
Quickly recover from critical events.
Sometimes a server may go offline due to unknown circumstances.
It may take several hours to properly audit the system and find out what happened.
In such a scenario, deploying a replacement server is the safest way to get your services back online while a detailed inspection is done on the affected server.
With CM and Automation, this can be done in a quick and reliable way.

	3. No More Snowflake Servers:
Manual system adminstration may seem like an easy  way to deploy and quickly fix servers.
But it comes with a price.
With time, it becomes difficult to know exactly what is installed on a server and which changes were made, when the process is not automated.
Manual hotfixes, configuration tweaks and software updates can turn servers into unique snowflakes that are hard to manage and replicate.But by using a CM tool, procedure necessary for bringing up a new server or updating an existing one will be documented in the provisioning scripts.

	4. Version Control for the Server Environment
So you have your server set up translated into a set of provisioning scripts.
Now you have the ability to apply to your server environment many of the tools and workflows you normally use for software source code.
Version control tools like git, can be used to keep track of changes made to the provisioning, and to maintain separate branches for legacy versions of the scripts(versions that have reached their end of life or are not actively maintained.) 
Version control can also be used to implement a code review policy for the provisioning scripts -> any changes shd be submitted as a pull request and approved by a project lead before being accepted. 
	5. Replicated environments:
CM makes it trivial to replicate environments with the same exact software and configurations.
Enables you to build multistage ecosystems with production, development and testing servers.
You could even use local virtual machines for development built with the same provisioning scripts.
This minimizes problems caused by environment discrepancies that occur when applications are deployed to production or shared btwn coworkers with diff machine setups ie diff OS, Software versions, Software Configurations.

		<p>OVERVIEW OF CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT TOOLS
Each CM tool has its own terms, philosophy and ecosystem.
They share many characteristics and have similar concepts.
Most CM tools use a controller/master and node/agent model.
The controller directs the configuration of the nodes, based on a series of instructions or tasks defined in your provisioning scripts.
	Most Common Features present in most configuration mgt tools for servers:
1. Automation framework
Provides a specific syntax and a set of features you can use to write your provisioning scripts.
Most CM toolshave features that make their language similar to conventional programming languages, but more simpler.
Variables, loops, conditionals: common features provided to create enable the creation of more versatile provisioning scripts. 

2. Idempotent behavior
CM Tools keep track of the state of resources so as to avoid repeating tasks that were executed before.
If a package was already installed, the tool will not try to install it again.
After each provisioning run, the system keeps the desired state even if you run it multiple times.
This is what is defined as idempotent behavior.
This behavior may not be enforced in all cases though.

3. System Facts
CM Tools usually provide detailed infor about the system being provisioned.
This data/infor is available thro global variables called facts.
This infor includes things like network interfaces, IP Addresses, OS, and didtribution.
Each tool provides a different set of facts.
These facts allow us to make provisioning scripts and templates more adaptive for multiple systems.

4. Templating Systems.
Most CM Tools provide a built in templating system.
This system facilitates setting up of configuration files and services.
Templates support variables, loops and conditionals -> maximise versatility.
Ex: you can use a template to easily set up a new virtual host within Apache.
Then reuse the same template for multiple server installations.
Instead of having hard coded static values, 
They contain placeholders for values that can change from host to host such as NameServer and DocumentRoot.

5. Extensibility
Provisioning scripts can be very specialized for the needs and demands of a particular server
However there are many cases where you have similar server setups or parts of a setup that could be shared between multiple servers.
Most provisioning tools provide ways in which you can easily reuse and share smaller chunks of your provisioning setup as modules or plugins.
You can also easily find third party modules and plugins on the internet, esp for common server setups like installing a PHP Web Server.
CM Tools have a strong community built around them, where users are encouraged to share their custom extensions.

Using extensions provided by other users saves you alot of time.
Also serves as an excellent way of learning how others solved common problems using your tool of choice.

		<h2>CHOOSING A CM TOOL</h2>
		<p>Many CM Tools available in the market. 
		Each has a different set of features and complexity levels. 
		Puppet, Chef, Ansible.
		Choose a tool that is a good fit for your needs.</p>

		<h3>Things to consider befor choosing a CM tool:</h3>
		<h4>Infrastructure Complexity</h4>
		<p>Most CM tools require a minimum hierarchy that consists of a controller machine and a node managed by
		the controller machine.
		For ex Puppet requires an agent application to be installed on each node,
		and a master application to be installed on the controller machine.
		Ansible has a decentralized structure.
		It does not require installation of additional software on the nodes.
		It relies on SSH to execute the provisioning tasks.
		For a small project a simplified infrastructure might seem like a better fit.
		However remember to take into consideration aspects like scalability and security, which may not be
		provided by the tool.

		Also some tools have more components and moving parts.
		This might increase the complexity of your infrastructure hence impacting on the learning curve,
		as well as increasing the cost of implementation.</p>
